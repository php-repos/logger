git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>
```

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - PHP 8.2 or higher.
   - [phpkg](https://phpkg.com/) for managing dependencies.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run:
     ```bash
     phpkg install
     ```

3. **Run Tests**:
   - Build the project:
     ```bash
     phpkg build
     ```
   - Navigate to the development build directory:
     ```bash
     cd builds/development
     ```
   - Run all tests using `php-repos/test-runner`:
     ```bash
     phpkg run https://github.com/php-repos/test-runner.git
     ```
   - To run a specific test file:
     ```bash
     phpkg run https://github.com/php-repos/test-runner.git run --filter=TestFilename
     ```

### Making Changes

1. **Follow Coding Standards**:
   - See the [Coding Standards](#coding-standards) section below.
   - Use `snake_case` for function and method names.
   - Ensure compatibility with PHP 8.2+.

2. **Write Tests**:
   - Add or update tests in the `Tests/` directory, following the existing testing style using `php-repos/test-runner`.
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting:
     ```bash
     phpkg build
     cd builds/development
     phpkg run https://github.com/php-repos/test-runner.git
     ```

3. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update `README.md` or other documentation for any changes to the public API.
   - Follow the existing documentation style with clear examples.

4. **Commit and Push**:
   - Write clear commit messages in the present tense (e.g., "Add custom signal type support").
   - Push your branch:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/<your-feature-name>
     ```

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Open a pull request from your branch to the `master` branch of `php-repos/logger`.
   - Include a descriptive title and details about your changes, referencing any relevant issues (e.g., "Fixes #123").

2. **Code Review**:
   - Respond to feedback and update your branch as needed.

3. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Ensure all CI checks pass. Fix any issues by updating your branch.

## Coding Standards

- **PHP Version**: Ensure compatibility with PHP 8.2+.

- **Code Style**:
   - Use meaningful variable and function names.
   - Include PHPDoc blocks for all classes, methods, and functions.
- **Testing**:
   - Write tests for all new functionality using `php-repos/test-runner`, matching the project's existing test style.
